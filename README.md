# orca-external-tools

This repository contains wrapper scripts compatible with the `otool_external` interface in ORCA.
The scripts call an external program, which computes the energy and gradient of a system, 
then pass this information back to ORCA for use in optimization, NEB, GOAT, MD, etc.

## Installation

Use the `install.py` to install the scripts. 
It will create a virtual environment, whose path should later on not be changed due to scripts linking the absolute path. 
The installation name and path of the virtual environment can be set upon installation:

```
python install.py --venv-dir <path/to/venv/dir/>
```

If you want to use either AIMNet2 or UMA, you can add `-e aimnet2` or `-e uma` to additionally install the required dependencies. 
As AIMNet2 and UMA require dependencies that are not compatible with each other, 
we recommend creating separate installations for each by specifying different virtual environment and script directories.

After installation, you should have a directory called `bin` (by default)
which contains all wrapper scripts that are usable out of the box. 
They may be moved and renamed freely as long as the original virtual environment stays in place. 
You can also modify the path to these scripts upon installation with the `--script-dir path/to/scripts/` keyword. 
If you want to have multiple installations, e.g., to use UMA as well as AIMNet2, 
be careful to provide different script paths to avoid overwriting.

The minimum Python version is currently 3.11.

### Testing
To test your installation, you can use the tests provided in the `tests` directory.
There are different subdirectories depending on which interface you want to test.
For testing, please activate the respective virtual `oet` environment that was installed with the `install.py` script, e. g., `source .venv/bin/activate`.
Afterward, execute the `test_<interface>.py` script in the respective `tests` subdirectories.
If you installed the scripts to a different directory, set the path to the script you want to test at the beginning of the `test_<interface>.py` file.

## Usage

### ORCA 5
A link named `otool_external` must be created in the ORCA executables directory, 
which points to the chosen script.
Optional arguments are not supported, so additional wrappers or hard-coded modifications may be necessary.

### ORCA 6
In addition to the `otool_external` route which is backwards-compatible,
it is also possible to set the full path to the chosen script via the environment variable `EXTOPTEXE`,
or via the ORCA input:
``` 
%method
  ProgExt "/full/path/to/script"
  Ext_Params "optional command line arguments"
end
```

### Server
For MLIPs like AIMNet2 and UMA, we recommend to use a server/client combination, 
as the calculations will otherwise take significantly longer,
due to heavy imports of dependencies like `torch`. 
Therefore, start a calculation server with the `oet_server` script, e.g., `oet_server aimnet2`. 
It will handle the single-point and gradient calculations and can remain active for multiple ORCA runs. 
The number of cores it is allowed to use can be specified with `-n <integer>`. 
In your ORCA input, you then have to specify the `oet_client` as `ProgExt`. 
It will forward all the calculation requests to the server. 
If you want to keep multiple servers running for different types of calculations, 
you have to specify different ports for the server and clients with the `-b <hostname>:<port>` keyword. 
Provide the keyword to the client via the ORCA input line `Ext_Params "-b <hostname>:<port>"`.

### UMA with Implicit Solvation (uma_solvated)
The `uma_solvated` calculator combines UMA energy/gradient calculations with xTB ALPB implicit solvation corrections.
This allows you to perform solvated UMA calculations through ORCA's ExtTool interface.

**Requirements:**
- xTB v6.7.1 or later must be installed and accessible (either in PATH or specified via `--xtb-exe`)
- All UMA dependencies must be installed (see Installation section)

**Usage with server:**
```bash
# Start the server
oet_server uma_solvated --bind 127.0.0.1:8888 --nthreads 4
```

**ORCA input file example:**
```
%pal nprocs 1 end
%maxcore 2000
!ExtOpt OPT NUMFREQ
%method
ProgExt "/path/to/oet_client"
Ext_Params "-b 127.0.0.1:8888 --solvent water"
end
*xyz 0 1
   O   0.0000   0.0000   0.1173
   H   0.0000   0.7572  -0.4692
   H   0.0000  -0.7572  -0.4692
*
```

**Available options:**
- `--solvent <name>`: Solvent name for xTB ALPB solvation correction (e.g., water, thf, toluene, acetonitrile, dmso, methanol). Use `none` to disable solvation correction. Default: none.
- `--xtb-exe <path>`: Path to xTB executable. Default: xtb.

The solvation correction is computed as:
```
E_total = E_UMA + (E_xtb(solvent) - E_xtb(vacuum))
```

Similarly for gradients, the correction is added to the UMA gradient.

## Interface

All scripts must be executable as:
```
scriptname <basename_EXT.extinp.tmp> [args]
```
where `basename_EXT.extinp.tmp` is the name of an input file generated 
by ORCA (see below) and `args` are optional command line arguments.
The latter can be provided in the ORCA input file (starting with ORCA 6) 
and are directly passed to the external script.

### Input syntax
The `extinp` file has the following format:
```
basename_EXT.xyz # xyz filename: string, ending in '.xyz'
0 # charge: integer
1 # multiplicity: positive integer
1 # NCores: positive integer
0 # do gradient: 0 or 1
pointcharges.pc # point charge filename: string (optional)
```
Comments from `#` until the end of the line should be ignored.

The file `basename_EXT.xyz` will also be present in the working directory with standard XYZ format:
```
<NAtoms>
comment line
<Element> <X> <Y> <Z>
...
```

### Output syntax
The script must generate a file called `basename_EXT.engrad` using the same `basename` as the XYZ file. 
This file must have the following format:
```
#
# Number of atoms: must match the XYZ
#
3
#
# The current total energy in Eh
#
-5.504066223730
#
# The current gradient in Eh/bohr: Atom1X, Atom1Y, Atom1Z, Atom2X, etc.
#
-0.000123241583
0.000000000160
-0.000000000160
0.000215247283
-0.000000001861
0.000000001861
-0.000092005700
0.000000001701
-0.000000001701
```
In ORCA 5, exactly 3 comment lines must be present between entries (as above).
In ORCA 6, comments from `#` until the end of the line are ignored, 
as are the (now optional) comment-only lines.

The script may also print relevant output to STDOUT and/or STDERR. 
STDOUT will either be printed in the ORCA standard output, 
or redirected to a temporary file and removed afterwards,
depending on the type of job and ORCA output settings.
